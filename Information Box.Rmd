        <li>Ridgeline plots make sense when the number of groups is medium to high. They help save space when groups overlap.</li>
        <li>Ridgeline plots are useful when there is a clear pattern in the ranking of groups. Otherwise, overlapping groups may make the plot messy and uninformative.</li>

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
